# 📊 JupyterHub Cost Estimator

## Overview
JupyterHub is an open source service that creates on-demand cloud-based Jupyter notebook servers, enabling users to interact remotely with a standardized computing environment through any web browser. This page helps you understand deployment options and estimate costs for different implementation scenarios.

## 🚀 JupyterHub Deployment Options

| Deployment Type | Available Options |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **Kubernetes-based** | • UC Merced's JupyterHub<br/>• Self-Hosted JupyterHub |
| **Single VM** | • The Littlest JupyterHub |

## ☁️ Kubernetes-based JupyterHub ☁️

Integrating JupyterHub with a Kubernetes engine allows for a robust and scalable version of JupyterHub, which gives the ability to deploy containerized environments while not being tied to any one cloud provider. Due to the customizability and scale it provides, the setup and maintenance for this option is the most complicated, taking longer to deploy.

See the comparison table below for a side-by-side comparison of UC Merced JupyterHub and Self-hosted JupyterHub:


### 📊 Comparison: UC Merced JupyterHub vs. Self-Hosted JupyterHub

| **Aspect**                 | **UC Merced JupyterHub**                                           | **Self-Hosted JupyterHub**                                                      |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 💸 **Cost**               | ❌ No Cost – Free for faculty and students                         | 💸 Cost borne by the user (compute, storage, network)                            |
| 👨‍🔧 **Management**       | ✅ Professionally managed by CIRT Team - OIT Dept, UC Merced        | 🧑‍💻 Requires individuals to manage their own infrastructure                     |
| 🛡️ **Maintenance**        | ✅ Updates and security handled by CIRT Team - OIT Dept, UC Merced  | 🔧 Individuals must handle all updates, patches, and backups                     |
| 🌐 **Cloud Provider Choice** | 🚫 Fixed (Managed by UC Merced infrastructure)                    | 🌐 Knowledge on AWS is mandatory
| 🧑‍🏫 **Ease of Use**       | ✅ Easy – No installation or setup required                         | ⚠️ Requires setup and environment configuration                                 |
| 📘 **Technical Expertise** | 🚫 Minimal – Ready-to-use environment                              | 📘 High – Knowledge of Kubernetes, DevOps needed                                 |
| 🧩 **Customization**       | 🧩 Some flexibility with package requests and extensions            | 🎨 Full customization of software and infrastructure                             |


> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT COST CONSIDERATION:** The self-hosted option requires dedicated IT specialists not reflected in this calculation. When comparing costs, you must factor in approximately 1-1.25 FTE of specialized expertise across cloud engineering, DevOps, and system administration. This team must continuously monitor and maintain the infrastructure. In contrast, the UC Merced JupyterHub is readily available and managed by the CIRT team.

## 📊 Cost Comparison Calculator

To compare between the **UC Merced JupyterHub service** and a **self-deployed cloud-based JupyterHub**, please refer to the cost estimation section and the calculator below. This tool allows you to estimate and compare both options side by side based on your specific class size and usage needs.

### 🧮 Calculation Method

The calculator uses the following methodology to estimate resource needs:

- **Number of Active Pods** = Total Users ÷ 4  
  - The number of active pods used by classes typically falls between 1/3rd and 1/6th of total users  
  - Dividing by 4 produces a good estimate for this number  

- **Recommended Memory** = 1 GB × Number of Active Pods  
  - Each pod is allocated 1 GB of memory  
  - Total memory requirement is calculated by multiplying this by the number of active pods  

- **Node Requirements** are calculated based on the total memory needed and the memory available on each node type

## 📦 The Littlest JupyterHub

In order to describe the costs of each option accurately, there are three dimensions of the set-up that must be considered: the allotment of memory/RAM, CPU usage, and disk space that each user would need. In that way, varying class sizes and needs differentiate the amount of resources given to each cost dimension. Four major options are outlined in the following chart to determine the allocation of resources across those three types: small classes (~30-50 students), average-sized classes (~80-100 students), and large classes (~100-400+). The following formulas for each of these three dimensions are widely applicable across different scenarios for The Littlest JupyterHub (TLJH):

- Recommended Memory = (Maximum Concurrent Users × Maximum Memory per User) + 128 MB  
- Recommended vCPUs = (Maximum Concurrent Users × Maximum CPU Usage per User) + 20%  
- Recommended Disk Size = (Total Users × Maximum Disk Usage per User) + 2 GB  
- Maximum amount of concurrent users should be approximately 40–60% of the total users at any given point  
- 1 GB typically serves as maximum memory per user, with 128 MB being overhead for TLJH and related services  
- Based on class sizes: 16 GB for 30 students, 64 GB for 100 students, and 256 GB for over 400 students  
- Most memory, vCPU, and disk installations come hand-in-hand, so memory calculation can be used to determine rest of setup  
  - 4 vCPUs and 32 GB disk space for small classes  
  - 16 vCPUs and 128 GB disk space for average-sized classes  
  - 64 vCPUs and 512 GB disk space for large classes  

| Class Size                      | Resources                                      | TLJH Pricing                           |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Small Class (~30-50 students)  | Memory: 16 GB<br/>CPU: 4 vCPUs<br/>Disk: 32 GB | m5.xlarge: $0.192/hr = $140.16/month  |
| Average-Size Class (~80-100)   | Memory: 64 GB<br/>CPU: 16 vCPUs<br/>Disk: 128 GB | m5.4xlarge: $0.768/hr = $560.64/month |
| Large Class (~400+ students)   | Memory: 256 GB<br/>CPU: 64 vCPUs<br/>Disk: 512 GB | m5.16xlarge: $3.072/hr = $2,242.56/month |
