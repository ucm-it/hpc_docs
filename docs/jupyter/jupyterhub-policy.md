### User Policies <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

1. Do not share accounts or passwords with others. 
2. Computing resources cannot be used for commercial, monetary purposes or personal gain. 


### Appropriate Use Policy <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

1. CIRT-managed JupyterHub should only be for Instruction/Teaching purposes. Any user that is found to be using computing resources for non-Instruction related purposes, such as but not limited to crypto-mining, blockchain or other illegal or illicit purposes will result in immediate termination of all jobs, deactivation of account and in accordance with all Univeristy Policies that apply. 
2. It is important for all users to always be aware and knowledgeable about what data and information is being placed onto CIRT-managed JupyterHub. P3/P4-level sensitive research data hosting is not supported in JupyterHub. 
3. Users are not permitted to try and bypass login or gain access to information or usage that is not granted to them. 
4. Never infringe upon someone else's copyright or plagerize someone else's intellectual property.

### Software and services <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

1. Users are generally permitted to download and install software within their own user environment (e.g., within a virtual environment or Jupyter notebook). This flexibility allows users to tailor their environment for specific instructional needs.
2. Users may request the Cyberinfrastructure and Research Team (CIRT) to install software package for broader use within the JupyterHub environment. This can be done through a [service hub](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=b83ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcbde&form_id=0cb3dca04f7d4300b52ba1618110c7ff) ticket submission process.
3. Due to resource constraints, not all requests can be accommodated. CIRT will prioritize software installation requests based on factors such as community demand, relevance to instructional goals, and resource availability.
4. CIRT reserves the right to deny installation requests for software/Pacakge that is deemed unsuitable or that may compromise the environment’s stability, security, or performance.
