Some researchers may have needs that exceed our campus computing capabilities. They may need more machines to complete a task quickly or they may need more specialized types of computing nodes (e.g. GPU nodes). We have access to both the [San Diego Supercomputing Center (SDSC)](https://www.sdsc.edu/) and the national-level computing resources known as XSEDE now [ACCESS](https://www.access-ci.org/). SDSC and ACCESS offer significant amounts of compute time to researchers interested in trying HPC at large-scales. 

Here's an example of the current resource provider for ACCESS and the computational resources available for users to apply for.
