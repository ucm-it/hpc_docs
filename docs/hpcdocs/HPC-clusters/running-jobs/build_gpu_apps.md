title: Building and Compiling GPU based Softwares and Applications

Many applications require to be built with GPU support, such as Kokkos, LAMMPS, deep learning frameworks, etc. This page will showcase how to install and build GPU-supported softwares/applications. 

The showcase will utilize the application, Kokkos, as our example application. 

## Allocating and Placement on a GPU Node 

The first step will be allocating a GPU node to be able to compile with GPU(CUDA) support. 

GPU nodes can be allocated via test partition (1 Hour Max TimeLimit) or via the `gpu` partition.

For shorter build times, `test` partition is a good starting point, however for longer GPU utilization allocate a node via `gpu` Queue.

To allocate a gpu node to be used interactively use the following line, `salloc --partition=<queue> --nodes=<#> --gres=gpu:X --time=<time>` where X will be replaced by 1 or 2 to denote how many GPU cards to use. 

More information can be found [here](https://ucm-it.github.io/hpc_docs/#/running_jobs) or for interactive jobs click [here](https://ucm-it.github.io/hpc_docs/#/interact_job)

Login Nodes Do Not Have GPUs

Once the job has been submitted and the resources have been allocated - 

Begin to run interactively via: `srun --jobid=<jobid> --pty /bin/bash`

An updated `user@gnode` should be similar to the image below. In the image the user is on the `gnode009`

## Checking GPU is Active  
Once placed on the GPU node, check the GPU resources on the node you are placed using `nvidia-smi`. If the GPU is properly activated a similar message will appear as below. 
<details>
  <summary>`nvidia-smi` Output</summary>
  Here is an example output of what `nvidia-smi` should output when running the command on a GPU Node

    ```bash

If a message stating that `nvidia-smi` command is not returning a similar message as above, open a ticket [here](https://ucmerced.service-now.com/servicehub?id=public_kb_article&sys_id=3c3ee9ff1b67a0543a003112cd4bcb13&form_id=06da3f8edbfc08103c4d56f3ce9619f4) and state the name of the GPU Node you are working on.

## Installing software/application 

Ensure the software has been cloned if it is from GitHub or downloaded from the original source. 

***If the Software requires `CUDA`, then `module load cuda`*** 

For the following demonstration of how to install a GPU-Supported application we will use `Kokkos`. The source can be found [here](https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos).


`Kokkos` makes use of the `cmake` system for building of the software. 

### Example: Installation and Building of `Kokkos`:

1. Clone the repository to the desired location via: `git clone https://github.com/kokkos/kokkos`

2. This software requires CUDA support so now we load CUDA via: `module load CUDA` 

3. Request an interactive job:  `salloc --partition=test --nodes=1 --gres=gpu:2 --time=00:30:00`

4. Begin interactive session: `srun --jobid=<JOBID> --pty /bin/bash` . Replace `<JOBID>` with the unique JobID during your session. 

5. Now ensure placement on a gnode with GPU resources active via the method outlined above. 

6. Now cd into Kokkos: `cd kokkos`

7. Now we begin to use the cmake system to build the Kokkos software     `cmake -B kokkos_build/ -DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=.local/ -S $PWD`. Here `kokkos_build` is our build directory that will be created during the execution of this line. The install prefix is a directory where the user wishes to have the software header files installed. 

:: Tip
In following the line above, ensure to change the build location and install prefix to use your building and install location. 
::

8. Execute the cmake build line to build the header files:   `cmake --build kokkos_build/`


9. Execute the install line to have these header files be installed into the `kokkos_build` and to be available in our install location (Example -  `~/.local/` ) folder via:   `cmake --install kokkos_build/`

If the build and installation were successful, `Kokkos` header files should be found in the installation location denoted in step one. 

To find the Kokkos build and installation options and further guidance refer to the Kokkos Documentation [here](https://kokkos.org/kokkos-core-wiki/quick_start.html). The Kokkos build and installation steps used above can also be found in the `Quick Start` section of the Kokkos documentation.
