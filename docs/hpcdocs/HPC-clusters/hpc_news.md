## CIRT team will be out of office attending the PEARC conference in Boston, MA from July 10-14 



The CIRT team will be out of office attending the PEARC conference in Boston, MA from July 10-14 and our level of campus support during that time will be extremely limited.

The best way to request support is always to open an appropriate ServiceHub request here. On these dates, we will only be available to address high impact issues impacting multiple research groups. Other requests will be addressed starting July 18.

Please plan ahead for any support you might need from CIRT!





## Pinnacles maintenance (06/06/2022-06/07/2022) 



CIRT will be performing regular OS and security patch upgrades on Pinnacles cluster.



<ins>When?</ins>



Monday, June 6, 2022 - Tuesday June 7, 2022.



Pinnacles cluster will be operational starting June 8, 2022.



Pinnacles cluster will be offline starting June 6, 2022.



Please plan your jobs ahead to avoid any disruptions. We encourage you to build in checkpoints for any work running during this period.



CIRT will send an ALL CLEAR email after successful maintenance.



## CIRT Recharge Center Hiatus Continues 4/25/2022   





OIT-CIRT recharge hiatus is still in effect.



We will continue to waive all costs for faculty using CIRT recharge services, including costs for using MERCED cluster core-hours, until further notice.



As a reminder, this recharge hiatus is retroactive to January 2022.This continues to be a fluid situation, but we anticipate that costs will be waived through at least July 2022, and possibly beyond.





Once details have been finalized, we will reach out again to inform you, and we will also provide all users with at least one month’s notice before recharges begin again.







Please note that during the recharge hiatus, CIRT will continue to monitor and record usage on the MERCED cluster toward our goal of operating as a recharge center.



However, faculty PIs will NOT be charged for core-hour usage on MERCED until recharge begins again.





## do_IRQ messages on MERCED Cluster 02/11/2021



Hope you're doing well and are keeping safe.



As some of you might have noticed, occasionally these messages are showing up on MERCED cluster command line -



`kernel:do_IRQ: 3.179 No irq handler for vector (irq -1)`



Until we can reboot the head node during the next maintenance cycle, the "do_IRQ" messages are not a sign of any kind of issue and will not damage or impede the system if they are present and these messages can be ignored (I know they're inconvenient BUT they are not harmful).



Sorry for the inconvenience and thank you for your cooperation.



## MERCED CLUSTER RECHARGE SERVICES STARTING 1/1/2022 



With the new NSF-MRI Cluster Pinnacles coming online, we are transitioning the MERCED cluster to a recharge service (effective January 1, 2022). Users will receive a monthly baseline allocation of 100 cycles and Faculty PIs will be responsible for covering costs that exceed this baseline.

 

The costs and policies for recharge were developed with consultation with the Committee on Research Computing (CoRC) and approved by the campus Recharge Committee.



**What is happening?**

Starting on January 1, 2022, each current MERCED cluster user will receive a baseline allocation of 100 core-hours(1) per month. If users stay below their baseline hours, no charge will occur. However, faculty PIs responsible for the user accounts will be charged monthly for core-hour usage over the baseline allocation.



**What is the unit and of cost service?**

MERCED cluster cycles are charged by core-hours(1).

 

(1)A core-hour is a single compute core(2) used for one hour (a core-hour) and 2G of RAM. The total cost in core-hours for a complete computation is:

 

Total Cost ($) = # of core-hours x Duration (wall clock hours) x Cost per core-hour

 

(2)A core is an individual processor: the part of a computer that executes programs. (Fun Fact: The MERCED cluster has about 3100 cores.)

 

For UC users, the cost per core-hour is $0.01 and the cost for non-UC external users is $0.02.

 

**I don’t want to pay for MERCED what are my options?**

Remember, if you stay below or at your baseline allocation, you will not incur any fees.

However, you can obtain access to other free compute resources such as our new NSF-MRI Pinnacles cluster, and XSEDE resources – and my team can provide consultation for how to access these resources.
