UC Merced Library help researchers develop computing and data management practices that promote the preservation, understanding, and reproducibility of their work.

They also teach a range of programming languages such as R, Python, and SQL, as well as complimentary computing skills such as Unix/Linux system administration, scripting, and version control. We also offer workshops and one-on-one consultations on project management, research computing, and writing data management plans.

## Visit the Data Lab
The Data Lab has 9 dedicated workstations for researchers and drop-in support for research computing and data management. Come find us in KL 336, on the 3rd floor of Kolligian Library West.
